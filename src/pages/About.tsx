        <p>
          Welcome to JAJ Dong Homes, where we turn dreams into reality by

          has expanded from his vision into a thriving organization of local
          professionals from the Lehigh Acres community. With over 8 years of
          experience in the home construction industry, we take pride in being a
          trusted, locally-rooted business, serving our neighbors with care and
          expertise.
